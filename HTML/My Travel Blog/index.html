    Tokyo, officially the Tokyo Metropolis,[b] is the capital and most populous city in Japan. With a population of over 14 million in the city proper in 2023, it is one of the most populous urban areas in the world. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighboring prefectures, is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with 41 million residents as of 2024. Lying at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kantō region, on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. It is Japan's economic center and the seat of the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards, which formerly made up Tokyo City; various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area; and two outlying island chains, the Tokyo Islands. Although most of the world recognizes Tokyo as a city, since 1943 its governing structure has been more akin to that of a prefecture, with an accompanying Governor and Assembly taking precedence over the smaller municipal governments that make up the metropolis. Special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a hub of commerce and business. Tokyo, originally known as Edo, rose to political prominence in 1603 when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate, and by the mid-18th century, Edo had evolved from a small fishing village into one of the largest cities in the world, with a population surpassing one million. After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). Tokyo was greatly damaged by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and by allied bombing raids during World War II. From the late 1940s, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion, which fueled the Japanese economic miracle, in which Japan's economy became the second-largest in the world at the time, behind that of the United States.[9] As of 2023, Tokyo is home to 29 of the world's 500 largest companies, as listed in the annual Fortune Global 500—the second highest number of any city.<br>

    <h2 id="budapest">Budapest</h2>

    Budapest is the capital and most populous city of Hungary. It is Hungary's primate city with 1.7 million inhabitants and its greater metro area has a population of about 3.3 million,[17][18] representing one-third of the country's population and producing above 40% of the country's economic output. Budapest is the political, economic, and cultural center of the country, among the ten largest cities in the European Union and the second largest urban area in Central and Eastern Europe. Budapest stands on the River Danube and is strategically located at the center of the Pannonian Basin, lying on ancient trade routes linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain. Budapest is a global city, consistently ranked among the 50 most important cities in the world, belongs to the narrow group of cities with a GDP over US$100 billion,[21] named a global cultural capital as having high-quality human capital,[22] and is among the 35 most liveable cities in the world.[23] The city is home to over 30 universities with more than 150,000 students, most of them attending large public research universities that are highly ranked worldwide in their fields, such as Eötvös Loránd University in natural sciences,[24] Budapest University of Technology in engineering and technology,[25] MATE in life sciences,[26] and Semmelweis University in medicine.[27] Budapest also hosts various international organizations, including several UN agencies,[28] the WHO Budapest Centre,[29] IOM regional centre,[30] the EU headquarters of EIT and CEPOL,[31][32] as well as the first foreign office of China Investment Agency.[33] Budapest opened the first underground transit line on the European continent in 1896,[34] which is still in use as M1 Millennium Underground, and today the fixed-track metro and tram network forms the backbone of Budapest's public transport system and transports 2.2 million people daily,[35] making it a significant urban transit system. The history of Budapest began with an early Celtic settlement transformed by the Romans into the town of Aquincum,[36][37] capital of Lower Pannonia in the 1st century.[36] Following the foundation of Hungary in the late 9th century,[38] the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241.[39] It became royal seat in 1361,[39] with Buda becoming one of the European centers of renaissance culture by the 15th century under Matthias Corvinus.[40][41][42] The siege of Buda in 1541 was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule,[43] and after the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda, Pest and Óbuda in 1873.[44][45] By this time, Budapest had become the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,[46] a great power that dissolved in 1918 following World War I. The city was also the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Battle of Budapest in 1945, and Hungarian Revolution of 1956.<br>
